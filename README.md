# 450-leetcode-questions

> Currently a work in progress. Around 250 questions have been replaced with LeetCode equivalents. More coming soon.

This is a list of popular Data Structures/Algorithms questions, with most of them being sourced from LeetCode.

> Note: Equivalents to some of the questions are completely unavailable on LeetCode. In such cases, the original link is kept as-is. If you find any links that haven't been added to the list, feel free to [create an issue](https://github.com/tusharsadhwani/450-leetcode-questions/issues/new).
